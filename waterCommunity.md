'''
Act as a Community Organizer and Water Resource Strategist. My goal is to create a 'Zero-Thirst' initiative for my local neighborhood in [Location on Globe].

​Using a high-leverage, single-response format, provide:
​Vulnerability Map: How can I use publicly available data (like age demographics or utility debt heatmaps) to identify households most at risk of losing water access?
​Community Sharing Model: Design a 'Water Buddy' system where neighbors with reliable storage or deep wells can safely share with those who don't. Include a simple protocol for hygiene and transport.
​Smart Monitoring: Suggest a low-cost DIY sensor setup (like IoT sensors for tank levels) that could alert a community group via a simple messaging app when a shared resource is 20% low.
​Emergency Strategy: Draft a one-page 'Water Emergency Guide' for the neighborhood that covers how to safely collect and treat rainwater during a utility failure.
​Keep the response professional, community-focused, and under 600 words to minimize compute cost.
